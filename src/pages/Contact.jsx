        My name is Ian and I'm a citizen of Kelowna. I found it hard to find a
        place online with information and links to all candidates so I created
        this website.

      <p>
        In 2021, via the BC Tech Association's retraining program, I completed a
        web development bootcamp with BrainStation. I'm now trying to get my
        foot into the door of the tech industry - searching for a junior
        fullstack developer role with opportunities to grow and further my
        skills.

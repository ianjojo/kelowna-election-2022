        This website was put together quickly to provide a one-stop shop for
        people unsure about how to vote in the upcoming civic election. The idea
        was to provide a listing of all candidates along with a link to their
        own websites, a photo and a short blurb about them or their platform.
        All candidates are listed alphabetically based on their last names.
      </p>
      <p className='intro'>
        I've contacted all candidates and asked for this short summary and so
        far about 60% of candidates have responded. The candidates who have
        replied to my email are now marked with a checkmark icon. Also, I've
        just launched a version for{" "}
        <a className='contactme' href='http://kelowna2022.com/west'>
          West Kelowna.
        </a>{" "}
        I've attempted to fill in the non-responders' summaries with information
        from the web - if any candidate would like to update their text,{" "}
        <a href='mailto:ianallanjohnston@gmail.com' className='contactme'>
          send me a message.
